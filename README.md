# hadoop-drivers
A Kaggle project - https://www.kaggle.com/c/axa-driver-telematics-analysis
Analyzes the behavior of each driver on the road and gets each driver's "signature".
From a huge repository of driver's trips (represented by a set of (x, y) coordinates of the driver for each second), finds fake trips, which do not belong to the driver.
